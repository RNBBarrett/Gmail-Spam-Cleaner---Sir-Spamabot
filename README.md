![Spam Cleaner Bot](https://github.com/RNBBarrett/Gmail-Spam-Cleaner---Sir-Spamabot/blob/main/spam-cleaning-robot.jpg?raw=true)

This Google Apps Script scans your Gmail inbox for spam keywords, unsubscribes from those emails if an unsubscribe link is available, and then deletes the mail. It then sends you a summary of what was deleted and unsubscribed from, including links to recover emails if necessary.

### Features:
- **Keyword-based spam detection**: Detects spam emails based on a customizable list of keywords.
- **Automatic Unsubscribe**: Unsubscribes from emails with an available unsubscribe link before deleting.
- **Detailed Summary**: Sends you a summary of deleted and unsubscribed emails, with links to restore them if necessary.

## ðŸš€ How to Set Up:

### 1. **Open Google Apps Script:**
- Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/).
- Click the `New Project` button to create a new Apps Script project.

### 2. **Paste the Code:**
- Copy the script from this repository.
- In the Google Apps Script editor, paste the script into the main code editor window.

### 3. **Save the Script:**
- Once the script is pasted, click the `File` menu and then `Save`.
- Give the project a name like `Gmail Spam Cleaner`.

### 4. **Grant Permissions:**
- Before running the script, Google Apps Script will request permissions to access your Gmail.
- Click `Run` -> `cleanUpSpam()` for the first time, and the script will prompt you to grant the necessary permissions.
- Follow the prompts and approve the required permissions to allow the script to manage your Gmail inbox.

### 5. **Set Up Triggers to Automate the Script:**

To make the script run automatically at a set interval (daily, weekly, etc.), you'll need to set up a trigger:

1. **Open the Triggers Menu:**
   - In the Apps Script editor, click the clock icon in the left-hand toolbar (or go to `Triggers` -> `Add Trigger` from the top menu).

2. **Create a Trigger:**
   - **Choose which function to run:** Select `cleanUpSpam`.
   - **Select event source:** Choose `Time-driven`.
   - **Select type of time-based trigger:** Select `Day timer` for daily cleanup, or `Week timer` for weekly cleanup.
   - **Set time of day:** Choose a specific time for the script to run (e.g., every morning).

3. **Save the Trigger:**
   - Click `Save`, and the trigger will be scheduled. The script will now run automatically at the selected intervals to clean your inbox.

```javascript
var spamKeywords = [
  'unsubscribe', 'promotion', // Add more keywords as needed...
];
