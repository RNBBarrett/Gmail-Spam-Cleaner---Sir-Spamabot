# Gmail-Spam-Cleaner---Sir-Spamabot
This Google Appscript scans your gmail inbox for spam keywords, unsubscribes from those emails if an unsubscribe link is available and then deletes the mail. It then sends you a summary of what was deleted and unsubscribed from with a link to take you to each email so you can recover them if necessary.
